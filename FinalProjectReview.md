Product Release / Project Presentation

1. Describe project experience including each phase of the SDLC and the project artifacts (design documents, requirements trace, test reports...)
The end goal of this project was to make it so users can easily track and manage their pets and know certain health concerns related to the breed, lifestyle, or age. Kind of like a wikipedia and a all in one spot for dog owners. I started this project late so did not do as many of the project artificats as I should have.


2. code and architecture walk-through
3. product demonstration

4. lessons learned:
- what did you do right?

- what did you do wrong?
I focused on the log in screens at first. I did not know about identity so I did not know those would have been made for me. That resulted in a significant delay in my project and not moving forward at all.

- where were you lucky?
I got lucky being able to undo identity. I was able to backtrack and undo all of the identity scaffolding without starting from scratch.

- what would you change / what do you know now that you wish you knew "then"?
I wish I knew about identity first as well as focusing more on re-learning the asp.net fundamentals. I think I was ambitious with my end goal and was not able to meet it. Working on side projects has made me learn new ways to use identity and learn more about html and css and wish I could go back to the start.
